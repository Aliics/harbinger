# harbinger
Harbinger is a docker orchestration made in python. The goal of Harbinger is to give an easy-to-use and friendly interface
to it's users. Sometimes using docker can end up being a huge bottleneck in your workflow, but maybe not with Harbinger.

# harbinger is currently a work in progress
As of right now, very few of Harbinger's promised capabilities are merely a thought or idea. Although, it will not be this way
for very long.

# docker is still dank
None of this would be possible without docker, I've just found that docker's cli is not very good and it's even worse with
multiple images/containers.
